Webinar with Anton Arhipov on functional microservices with Ktor and Arrow.

The code can be found in the [Ktor Arrow Example](https://github.com/nomisRev/ktor-arrow-example) repository.

[![Building applications with Kotlin and Arrow.kt in style](http://img.youtube.com/vi/g79A6HmbW5M/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g79A6HmbW5M "Building applications with Kotlin and Arrow.kt in style")

In this session, we are going to build an end-to-end example that uses the patterns we have discussed in the previous session [Functional programming in Kotlin with Arrow.kt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDMmmrRhUvQ) about functional programming with Kotlin and Arrow.kt. 

This time, we will look at the complete workflow from beginning to end, from handling the request, interacting with the database, and sending a response. All in a functional style, of course.
